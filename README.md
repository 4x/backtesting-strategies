# README

**Backtesting Strategies with R** is a book written to bring together online resources and tutorials showcasing the `quantmod`, `blotter`, `TTR` packages and more. It is licensed under GNU GPLv3 (see LICENSE). 

In addition to the package demo's and other online resources, I want to also add information such as [using AWS](http://timtrice.github.io/backtesting-strategies/obtaining-resources.html) and perhaps another cloud service for computational power. I want to also add a chapter on statistical analysis, overfitting, curve-fitting, etc. Chapters will be added at a minimum as placeholders as I think of them. 

I've tried to keep the set up of the book rather simple. The book is published using `bookdown` with HTML output printed to the project root directory. This library produces the *_main_files* and *assets* directory which should never be modified. 

The raw code for all strategies can be found in the *R* directory along with functions and symbols used in the book. 

The *_data* directory holds RData files saved in the strategies. All strategy objects should be saved into this directory. 

Any requested changes should be filed in Issues. 

The book is written using R 3.2.3. Please see [Libraries](http://timtrice.github.io/backtesting-strategies/index.html#libraries) for additional minimum requirements.
